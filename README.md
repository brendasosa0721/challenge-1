## Class Repository (Gitlab)

**Question**: What is this Class Repository (GitLab)?

**Answer**: You can think of the class repository on GitLab as a textbook for the course. Just like how you have a platform that holds all of your asynchronous content, your class repository will hold all of your Virtual Class content. This means that any activities that youâ€™ll go through during class will be stored here, ready for you to download!
