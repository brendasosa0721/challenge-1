## Class Repository (Gitlab)

**Question**: What is this Class Repository (GitLab)?

**Answer**: You can think of the class repository on GitLab as a textbook for the course. Just like how you have a platform that holds all of your asynchronous content, your class repository will hold all of your Virtual Class content. This means that any activities that youâ€™ll go through during class will be stored here, ready for you to download!

Review the following pre-work module to better understand what this class repository is: https://courses.bootcampspot.com/courses/1620/pages/1-dot-8-class-repository-gitlab-guide?module_item_id=483856


Challenge 1 For Bootcamp
This challenge was about identifying errors in the html and css to make this website more readble and provide long term usability. 
I was able to identify some of the errors or not clean coding in the head, body and footer. Also, I added the alt to the images, make the title to match the website name since it had a different name. 

I tried my best to do as much as I can and I know a few things are missing but I cannot figure out.
